      <h2>Welcome to Our Automated Event Management System</h2>
      <p>
        Our project is an automated event invitation and attendance management
        system designed to streamline the process of inviting guests to
        important events. This system leverages WhatsApp Business API to send
        personalized invitations, confirm attendance, provide event details, and
        track guest arrivals through QR code validation. The solution enhances
        event organization efficiency and ensures seamless communication between
        event hosts and attendees.
